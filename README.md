A Sorting Algorithm Visualizer I made with Reactjs. To initiate the sort, press random then the play button. 

Algorithm is a flashy word. I find people get intimidated by it because when they hear the word algorithm, they think of a Google algorithm. With this project, I wanted to show there are different types of algorithms and that are quite easy to understand especially when broken down to this smallest components. 

Plus, they can be very cool to visualize. With this project I hope to educate people who want to understand algorithms a bit more but have a hard time visualizing what is specifically going on.

I visualized 3 different sorting algorithms: Bubblesort, Selectionsort, and Insertionsort.
